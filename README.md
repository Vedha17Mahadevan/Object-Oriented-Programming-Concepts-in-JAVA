# Object-Oriented-Programming-Concepts-in-JAVA
Playing around with OOP concepts in Java‚Äîjust a bunch of classes, objects, and plenty of ‚Äúwhy isn‚Äôt this working?‚Äù moments! üòÖ

1. Write a java program that checks whether the given string is palindrome or not.

2) Write a Java Program to find the frequency of characters in a string. 

3) Write a Java program to multiply two given matrices. 

4) Write a Java program which creates a class named 'Employee' having the following members: Name, Age, Phone number, Address, Salary. It also has a method named 'printSalary( )' which prints the salary of the Employee. Two classes 'Officer' and 'Manager' inherits the 'Employee' class. The 'Officer' and 'Manager' classes have data members 'specialization' and 'department' respectively. Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an officer and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same. (Exercise to understand inheritance). 

5) Write a java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains an empty method named numberOfSides( ). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Hexagon such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method numberOfSides( ) that shows the number of sides in the given geometrical structures. (Exercise to understand polymorphism). 

6) Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of garbage collector.

7) Write a Java program that reads a line of integers, and then displays each integer, and the sum of all the integers (Use String Tokenizer class of java.util).
